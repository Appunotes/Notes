What is the difference between XSS and CSRF? 
XSS involves causing a web site to return malicious JavaScript, while CSRF involves inducing a victim user to perform actions they do not intend to do. 

What is the difference between XSS and SQL injection? 
XSS is a client-side vulnerability that targets other application users, while SQL injection is a server-side vulnerability that targets the application's database. 

What are HTTP methods you know?
GET – Retrieves data.

POST – Submits data.

PUT – Updates existing resource.

DELETE – Deletes a resource.

HEAD – Like GET, but returns headers only.

OPTIONS – Returns allowed HTTP methods.

PATCH – Partially updates a resource.

TRACE – Echoes the received request (used for debugging).

CONNECT – Used to establish a tunnel (typically for SSL).

Is CSRF possibale IF content type is set to  application/json?
When a website accepts data in application/json format, it usually expects that data to come from JavaScript (AJAX requests).
But browsers have a built-in security rule called the Same-Origin Policy (SOP). 
This rule blocks one website from sending certain types of requests (like JSON) to another website unless the target site explicitly allows it.
why is CSRF hard with JSON?
HTML forms (used in classic CSRF attacks) cannot send JSON data.

JavaScript can send JSON (application/json), but only if the server allows it through CORS.
By default, most browsers block JavaScript from sending cross-site JSON requests, protecting against CSRF.

CSRF: 
Can CSRF tokens prevent XSS attacks? 
If the XSS payload requires a valid CSRF token to work, and the attacker can’t guess it, then the attacker can’t easily make a victim run that malicious request. That’s how CSRF token indirectly protects against that reflected XSS exploitation — not the XSS itself.
Bypassing CSRF token validation
**Bypassing CSRF token validation**
Common flaws in CSRF token validation

1. Validation of CSRF token depends on request method
Some applications correctly validate the token when the request uses the POST method but skip the validation when the GET method is used.
In this situation, the attacker can switch to the GET method to bypass the validation and deliver a CSRF attack:
2. Validation of CSRF token depends on token being present
Some applications correctly validate the token when it is present but skip the validation if the token is omitted.
In this situation, the attacker can remove the entire parameter containing the token (not just its value) to bypass the validation and deliver a CSRF attack: 
3.CSRF token is not tied to the user session
Some applications do not validate that the token belongs to the same session as the user who is making the request. Instead, the application maintains a global pool of tokens that it has issued and accepts any token that appears in this pool.
In this situation, the attacker can log in to the application using their own account, obtain a valid token, and then feed that token to the victim user in their CSRF attack. 

** Double Submit Cookie CSRF Prevention Technique?
Double Submit Cookie is a method to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks without requiring server-side session storage.
Basic idea:
The server sets a cookie with a random CSRF token.
The client (browser) reads the cookie and sends that same token again inside the request body or header when making a sensitive request.
The server checks that:
The CSRF token in the cookie matches the CSRF token in the request body/header.
If they match → allow the request.
If they don't match → block the request.
Why is it called "double submit"?
Because the same CSRF token is submitted twice: once via cookie and once via request body or header. ( basically we are adding csrf token in cookie and via body or header)
